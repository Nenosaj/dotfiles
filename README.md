## 🚀 Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Nenosaj/dotfiles.git ~/dotfiles
cd ~/dotfiles
```

### 2. Link Config Files (Manual Example)

```bash
ln -s ~/dotfiles/.zshrc ~/.zshrc
ln -s ~/dotfiles/nvim ~/.config/nvim
ln -s ~/dotfiles/i3 ~/.config/i3
# Repeat as needed
```

> Or use your own method like GNU Stow, `chezmoi`, or a setup script.

## 🧪 Tested On

- ✅ Arch Linux
- ⚠️ Other distros not tested yet

---

## 🛠️ Notes

- Uses Lua-based Neovim config
- Polybar and Rofi are themed to match
- Fastfetch replaces neofetch for system info
- Scripts directory includes personal utilities
- `.zshrc` tuned for development, includes aliases & plugin support
